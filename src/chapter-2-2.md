Types of Artificial Intelligence
===================================================================================================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that has grown exponentially in recent years. In this chapter, we will explore the background and fundamentals of AI, including the different types of AI that exist.

Background of Artificial Intelligence
-------------------------------------

AI refers to the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and language translation. The history of AI dates back to the 1950s, and since then, the field has evolved significantly, with breakthroughs in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning.

Types of Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------

There are three main types of AI:

### 1. Rule-Based AI

Rule-based AI, also known as expert systems, uses a set of predefined rules to make decisions or solve problems. These rules are based on the knowledge and expertise of human experts and are programmed into the system. Rule-based AI is useful for tasks that have a clear set of rules and can be automated.

### 2. Machine Learning

Machine learning is a type of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead, algorithms are used to identify patterns in data and make predictions or take actions based on those patterns. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

### 3. Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to analyze complex data sets. Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that process information and make predictions based on that information. Deep learning is useful for tasks such as image and speech recognition.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, AI is a rapidly evolving field that has seen significant advances in recent years. There are three main types of AI: rule-based AI, machine learning, and deep learning. Each type of AI has its own strengths and weaknesses, and different types are suited to different applications. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of this technology in smart building design and operations.
