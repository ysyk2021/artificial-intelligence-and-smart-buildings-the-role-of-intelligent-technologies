Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that is transforming many industries, including building design and operation. This chapter will provide an overview of the history of AI, the different types of AI, and the machine learning techniques that are commonly used in AI-based systems.

History of Artificial Intelligence
----------------------------------

The concept of artificial intelligence dates back to the mid-20th century, when researchers began exploring the potential of machines that could think and learn like humans. Some of the key milestones in the development of AI include:

* The Dartmouth Conference: In 1956, a group of researchers gathered at Dartmouth College to discuss the potential of creating intelligent machines. This conference is widely regarded as the birthplace of modern AI.
* Expert systems: In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers developed expert systems that could mimic human decision-making in specific domains. These systems were based on rule-based reasoning and represented an early form of AI.
* Neural networks: In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers began to develop neural networks that could learn from experience and improve their performance over time. This led to breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition and speech processing.
* Deep learning: In the past decade, the development of deep learning techniques has revolutionized AI, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing and computer vision.

Overall, the history of AI has been one of constant innovation and discovery, with researchers continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

Types of Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------

There are two main types of AI: narrow or weak AI, and general or strong AI. Narrow AI refers to systems that are designed to perform specific tasks, such as facial recognition or natural language processing. General AI, on the other hand, refers to systems that are capable of performing a wide range of cognitive tasks at human-level or above.

Within these two broad categories, there are several different subtypes of AI that are commonly used in building design and operation. These subtypes include:

* Rule-based systems: These systems are based on a set of rules that dictate how the system should respond to different inputs or situations.
* Fuzzy logic systems: Fuzzy logic systems are designed to handle uncertain or imprecise data, and can be used to model complex systems such as HVAC systems in buildings.
* Expert systems: Expert systems use a knowledge base and inference engine to simulate human decision-making in a specific domain.
* Neural networks: Neural networks are modeled on the structure and function of the human brain, and can be used for tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.
* Deep learning systems: Deep learning systems use multi-layer neural networks to learn from large datasets, and have been used for tasks such as speech recognition and autonomous driving.

Machine Learning Techniques
---------------------------

Machine learning is a key component of many AI-based systems, and involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data. There are several different machine learning techniques that are commonly used in building design and operation, including:

* Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a specific output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on this training data.
* Unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where there are no predefined outputs. The algorithm must identify patterns in the data without any guidance.
* Reinforcement learning: In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

Overall, by understanding the history and fundamentals of AI, building managers can better understand the potential of these technologies for promoting sustainability, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing occupant comfort and productivity.
